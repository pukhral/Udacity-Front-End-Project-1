Q4) How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?


Ans: The mockup helped me a lot. I was able to transfer it into my code. There were a lot of things I missed while I was applying tags. Minute things that I missed 
     during coding are:
a) I forgot to include this "***" under bold and emg tags.
b) I forgot to close figure tag with right angled bracket.
c) As <strike> is deprecated, I used css.
d) While apply <a> tags , text got erased, automatically.
